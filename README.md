## Overview
This is a **dynamic performance dashboard** which shows the sales data of a hypothetical company, Nord Tech. I developed this dashboard with the help of **MS Excel 2016** and incorporated **pivot tables**, **filters** and **timeline boxes**. Nord Tech basically sells electronic applications like printer, mouse, keyboard, etc and it has salesmen throughout different regions i.e North, South, East, and West.  **Any relevant data added will be updated in the dashboard automatically upon refresh**.


## Motivation

I wanted to design a dashboard which is not generic and has something unique in it, so I made this dashboard.


## Workflow

- **Data Cleaning**:
    - **Unwrapped** the **wrapped data**.

    - Converted the **raw data** to a **table**.

    - Converted the amount in **numeric format** from **text format**.
    
    - Converted Dates from text to date format using **Text to Column** option.

- **Data Analysis**:

  - Made a **Sales by Months** pivot table and also a line chart out of it which contained amount in the y axis and month in the x axis.
  - Similarly made **Sales of Products** which is a **horizontal bar chart** which contained **% of products sold in x-axis** and **products** in the **y-axis**, and **Sales by Region** which is a **bar chart** which contained **regions** in the **x-axis** and **total amount of sales done** in **y-axis**.
  - Added **item** and **region filters**.
  - Added **timeline** which contained **range of months** so the user could select from which month to which the dashboard should display the details.
  - **Designed** the dashboard and inserted **linked button** so that the user could move from one sheet to another.


## Challenges-I-Faced

- Took some time in data cleaning because I had to analyze everything before making any changes so that the final output dosen't change.
